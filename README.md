For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Add a schedule page or section so the user can see what time are partially booked or free.

## Testing 


Testing was carried out as each section was created or edited.
A problem found was to add color to the header and footer. No fix for adding color to the header was found but partial footer color was added.
Adding images in line with text proved problematic but the result is satisfactory.
Once the site was deployed no images loaded. Many solutions had been tried before discovering the delay between pushing to git hub and the result having effect.
Also once deployed the free and contact links on the solo and group pages no longer worked. 
The alignment of items in the what we do section and the nav bar on the header proved problematic on smaller screens. Although the is still room for improvement in the nav bar alignment, the site is still functional on smaller screens.




### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Feoin988.github.io%2Fwood-sessions%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Feoin988.github.io%2Fwood-sessions%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select Deploy from a branch.
  - Select Main in the branch drop down
  - Once the main branch has been selected, press save and allow the site to be deployed
  - Once complete and address is shown for the website.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
